The \emph{Ajax} Multi-Commentary --- available at
https://multi.ajmc.ch [cite:@Pletcher.EtAl2024] --- is a born-digital platform for
simultaneously consulting the past 200 years of commentaries on
Sophocles' \emph{Ajax} alongside a more or less uncontroversial
edition of the critical text (Lloyd-Jones and Wilson's OCT, as
digitized by the Perseus Project). Hereafter called the ``AjMC'' for
short, this project involves a fair amount of computational
heavy-lifting: OCR on scans of thousands of pages of commentaries,
including automated detection of each page's layout; natural language
processing and named entity recognition to determine citations and
other nouns of interest within each glossa; and a reading environment
that provides interfaces for all of the above as well as ways to
change the critical text, tabulate citations, and view lemmata and
glossae at a glance.

If we have time, I'd be happy to present a live demo of the
application later. For now, I'm hoping that a screenshot will suffice
to give you a sense of how the application works. You can see that we
have navigation and filters for the available (public-domain)
commentaries on the left, the critical text in the center, and glossae
on the right. (I'm using the term ``glossae'' somewhat freely here, as
its what we call the whole object in the programming environment.)
I've expanded one of the glossae to show that it includes an OCR
transcription as well as an scanned image of the page, with the
relevant comment and lemma (if available) highlighted in blue.

To start, we'll discuss the reading environment's ``heat\-map'' of
citations, which shows the density of glossae among all available
commentaries on each lemma. From this starting point, we will briefly
highlight the various actors and networks that emerge in the seemingly
--- but only seemingly --- synchronic presentation of commentaries,
before finally presenting a few thoughts on how an ANT-informed view
of the multi-commentary enriches our reading experience and opens up
new avenues of investigation in the commentary tradition.


** A note about reading commentaries this way

#+BEGIN_quote
    Action should remain a surprise, a mediation, an event. It is for
    this reason that we should begin, here again, not from the
    ‘determination of action by society’, the ‘calculative abilities
    of individuals’, or the ‘power of the unconscious’ as we would
    ordinarily do, but rather from the under-determination of action,
    from the uncertainties and controversies about who and what is
    acting when ‘we’ act—and there is of course no way to decide
    whether this source of uncertainty resides in the analyst or in
    the actor. [cite:@Latour2005 p. 45]
#+END_quote

[Read quotation]

Engaging with commentaries in this way brings Latour's questions about
the under-determination of action to the fore. It discombobulates our
sense of ``we'' and makes clear how the networks of citation and
comment challenge our ability to locate the sources of uncertainty.


** Reading with a multi-commentary

#+BEGIN_quote
If it is true, as ANT claims, that the social landscape possesses such
a flat `networky' topography and that the ingredients making up
society travel inside tiny conduits, what is in between the meshes of
such a circuitry? ... I call this background plasma, namely that which
is not yet formatted, not yet measured, not yet socialized, not yet
engaged in metrological chains, and not yet covered, surveyed,
mobilized, or subjectified. [cite:@Latour2005 p. 242; p. 244]
#+END_quote

In so doing, reading with a ``multi-commentary'' also forces us to
confront the endless recursions of interpretation that are prompted by
/any/ commentary, meaning that we need to investigate what Latour
refers to as the empty space between the threads in the network.

** Second /stasimon/ (vv. 693–718)

In order to demonstrate this point, I want to look at a few glossae on
the second stasimon. (If the glossae look a little sparse, it's
because we're only highlighting lines and lemmata that
have been confirmed by hand. We hope to have filled out most of
the annotations by next summer.)

As this screenshot on the first few lines shows, several comments
overlap by targeting the lemma
\foreignlanguage{polytonicgreek}{ἔφριξ'} in line 693. It is tempting
at first to treat these comments and the citations that they contain
as what Rita Felski has called ``network-y'' networks
[cite:@Felski2016 p. 748]. We certainly could deploy some network
theory here, where, for example, each commentary is a vertex with
edges connecting it to the web of shared references that emerge from
the glossae's internal citations --- but to do so is beyond the scope
of this presentation.

Rather, we would do well to take a leaf from Michael Witmore's
article, ``Latour, the Digital Humanities, and the Divided Kingdom of
Knowledge,'' and notice how ``No matter how distinctive or
statistically sound the pattern discovered is, one has done nothing to
explain it until one provides a motivated link between the features in
question, their patterned distribution, and something else that this
pattern is a proxy /for/'' [cite:@Witmore2016 p. 366]. Witmore's
argument deals mainly with the complementarity of humanistic and
quantitative modes of inquiry, drawing on Latour's notion of ``objects
of concern'' to theorize the aforementioned feature-proxy
relationship.

In Latourian terms, the glossae here are actors, and the network ---
really, as both Felski and Latour stress, the assemblage --- of
citations that they summon necessarily occurs through the intervention
of the reader of the multicommentary.

* Commentaries: Intermediaries or mediators?

** Of pointers and pencils

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A network is not so much something we find as something we make; it is
the pencil rather than the object drawn; it is a means of checking how
much ``energy, movement, and specificity our own reports are able to
capture.'' [cite:@Felski2016 749]
#+END_QUOTE

Early in her 2016 article on ANT and literary studies, Felski
clarifies what Latour means by network by comparing it to a pencil:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

the pencil rather than the object drawn; it is a means of checking how
much ``energy, movement, and specificity our own reports are able to

#+END_QUOTE

Like Felski's pencil, the multicommentary is not an inert object to be
stumbled upon but a tool for activating relationships among
commentators, primary texts, and readers. Even when we focus on these
older, public-domain commentaries, the pencil metaphor reminds us that
we must continually encounter their immediacy. This reading
environment, if I may be so bold, provides tools for assembling a
critical network that lets us notice new things --- or re-notice old
things --- about the relationship between commentaries and the texts
that they gloss and cite.

** Commentaries as mediators

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An /intermediary/, in my vocabulary, is what transports meaning or
force without transformation: defining its inputs is enough to define
its outputs.... /Mediators/, on the other hand ... transform,
translate, distort, and modify the meaning of the elements they are
supposed to carry. [cite:@Latour2005 p. 39]
#+END_QUOTE

*** Note
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:

When Latour articulates the difference between an intermediary and a
mediator, he gestures towards a debate at least as old as Plato's
/Phaedrus/: What can that scroll of Lysias up one's sleeve --- or
that commentary in the sidebar --- actually say?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

force without transformation: defining its inputs is enough to define
its outputs.... /Mediators/, on the other hand ... transform,
translate, distort, and modify the meaning of the elements they are
supposed to carry. [cite:@Latour2005 p. 39]
#+END_QUOTE

Latour's radical move, which gets him dangerously close to some
elements of new materialism that ought to give us pause, is to show
that even the ``dead and rigid knowledge shut up in /biblia,'' to draw
Derrida into the conversation, can nevertheless participate as
mediators and actors in the social realm of the philologist's work.

* Multi-commentaries: What do they do?

** What can't multi-commentaries do?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Third, interactions are not /synoptic/. Very few of the participants in
a given course of action are simultaneously visible at any given
point. The lecturer might believe she is center stage, but that does
not mean that many others are not acting as well, only that there is
no way to sum them up. [cite:@Latour2005 p. 201]
#+END_QUOTE

*** Note
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:

In Latour's list of five things that face-to-face interactions cannot
do, he notes that ``Third, interactions are not /synoptic/.'' If
you'll permit me to treat reading a commentary as a kind of
face-to-face interaction --- even if only a poor proxy for one ---
this condition of the interaction seems to me one that we often
forget. It is easy to slip into a mental mode where we believe that we
have brought together all of the relevant knowledge on a passage under
a single heading, but the multicommentary and Latour help to disabuse
us of this notion by reminding us of all the knowledge that is not
there. The multicommentary /calls attention to our attention/, that
is, it makes us notice where our eye wanders on the screen, which
commentators and citations we look for and which we overlook.

It is somewhat paradoxical that manually flipping through pages of
large commentaries makes it easier to fall for the synoptic illusion
of the knowledge that we have thereby assembled. But the homogeneity
of the multicommentary interface, I want to suggest, makes it more
obvious that we are dealing with actors that bring their own
positions, networks, and histories to bear on our own work --- even
if, as Finglass and others have shown, we mostly forget any Sophoclean
commentator before Jebb [cite:@Finglass2015].

* Conclusion: Travelers on the commentary tradition

** A movable network

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Whereas the tradition distinguished the common good (a
moralist concern) and the common world (naturally given), I proposed
replacing ‘the politics of nature’ by the progressive composition of
one common world. This was, in my view, the way to redefine science
and politics and to carry out the task of political epistemology
forced upon us by the various ecological crises. [cite:@Latour2005 p. 254]
#+END_QUOTE

Throughout /Reassembling the Social/, Latour uses the metaphor of traveling,
and specifically traveling slowly, to describe his and the reader's approach
to Actor–Network Theory. In the conclusion, this metaphor is subsumed under
the heading of various notions of progress, as in the quotation on this slide:

#+END_QUOTE

Although the multicommentary presented here at first appears to be a
static entity --- and in a punnily ironic twist, it is built as a
static collection of files that do not depend on a server --- I think
it is useful to think about the assemblage of commentaries
ecologically, that is, as a collective that forces us to reckon with
how we order our epistemological /oikoi/.

If the multicommentary succeeds in generating networks of citations,
it is thanks in large part to the efforts of the readers who fill in
the gaps --- what Latour calls ``plasma'' --- between glossae, primary
texts, and even the historical situations of the commentators
themselves. Above all, I hope to have shown that even Hermann's
pedantic Latin commentary --- to take just one example --- has the
potential to join modern assemblages of glossae to help us see /Ajax/
differently. By mobilizing these different points of view, we tap into
the core effort of renewing and reusing these texts that, despite
changes in the social order, have stuck with us for twenty-five hundred
years.

Thank you.
